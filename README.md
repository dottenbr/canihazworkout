## How to do the workout routines?

A couple of the workouts used are illustrated here:

I have left 5 (Step-up onto chair) and 7 (triceps dip) out since there is possibilities of hurting yourself
with a weak chair. 9 (High knees running in place) is called "Barefoot run" in this program.
Read "Born to Run" by Christopher McDougall to learn more about barefoot or minimal running.

The very last excercise, "the parachuter" is missing in the illustration. For that one just lie on your belly 
and raise your legs and arms behind you just if you were falling from a plane ready to pull your parachute.
